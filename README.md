# ğŸŸ¡ğŸ”´ Connect Four Game (FastAPI + React + Vite) ğŸŸ¡ğŸ”´
This is a simple project in my journey of learning and trying out Python :)
My project has two modes: 1. 2 Players Mode
                          2. Player vs Bot
### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MelisBunjaku19/Connect-Four-Game.git

1. Navigate to the backend folder(cd backend) (where `main.py` lives).
2. Start the FastAPI server with:

```bash
py -m uvicorn main:app --reload

1. Navigate to the frontend folder( cd frontend) and run:
--> npm run dev


Have fun playing! :)
